They built up Roman for such a needlessly long time (this title reign has gone on long past its sell by date, in my book), now Rock is coming in like he's the biggest deal instantly when he wasn't even the most important name of his own era (at least to the industry itself).  Like, yeah, Rock oozes charisma, and he gets mainstream attention, but you can't mortgage all you built for his sake.  It's all about Cody vs. Roman, so let THEM be the ones to cook.

Even with Cody\\'s stakes at play, it seems more important to HHH to break records than tell a compelling story.

The Rock was never the best wrestler, he wasn't a classic in ring mystro, but he's a performer and put on a show. Again Roman can't, and he does really have the in ring work to make up for his lack of character.\\n\\nTake Bret Hart for example, generally Bret was an average mic worker, he wasn't the greatest character worker, but his in ring storytelling and ring craft was on another level and made up for his short comings in other areas. Roman just has none of it, so much so that I really question why WWE invested so much into him for so many years of not being able to do it. Don't get me wrong Roman is fine in the ring and OK on the mic now, but fine and OK aren't worthy of a title let alone the main title, let alone the main title with records left right and centre.

Reigns might be the one more overrated by the company but Rollins is overrated by the fans.  He’s not Daniel Bryan… he’s just a guy that says yes to what the higher ups want.  He’s been the beneficiary of huge storylines that give a smoke and mirrors appearance to his status.  He’s injured many guys in the ring.  He’s terrible at promos and has an awful mic presence.  His entrance music is his biggest attraction, adding more “chantable” parts as his character becomes more and more stale.  He dresses in crazier and crazier attire without it tying into any kind of character arc.  It’s not like when Goldust did it, that was character driven.  This is just him trying to be flashy to make up for a lack of character.  He married Becky as she ascended which helped cement his legacy.

His 1300+ days with the Universal belt isn\\'t so impressive as much as it\\'s a running gag by this point. He shows up every 3-4 months, retains the belt as scripted to no one\\'s surprise, and then disappears again until his next contractual obligation. There is no feeling of \"Will THIS be the night Roman loses the belt?\" because the overarching plan is for him to keep it for a specific amount of time. Even with Cody\\'s stakes at play, it seems more important to HHH to break records than tell a compelling story. As much of an upset it would be for Cody to lose to Roman at Wrestlemania AGAIN, at this point they might as well just let him keep it for another six months to knock Hogan out of the top three. \\n\\nI\\'d be VERY surprised if Roman doesn\\'t retain at WM40.'}, {'comment': 'WM 40 stage construction begins'}, {'comment': 'During the promo Punk did ok, Drew dropped some bombs and Seth proved he cant hang.

The Rock was never the best wrestler, he wasn't a classic in ring mystro, but he's a performer and put on a show. Again Roman can't, and he does really have the in ring work to make up for his lack of character.\\n\\nTake Bret Hart for example, generally Bret was an average mic worker, he wasn't the greatest character worker, but his in ring storytelling and ring craft was on another level and made up for his short comings in other areas. Roman just has none of it, so much so that I really question why WWE invested so much into him for so many years of not being able to do it. Don't get me wrong Roman is fine in the ring and OK on the mic now, but fine and OK aren't worthy of a title let alone the main title, let alone the main title with records left right and centre.

He shows up every 3-4 months, retains the belt as scripted to no one\\'s surprise, and then disappears again until his next contractual obligation.

Even with Cody\\'s stakes at play, it seems more important to HHH to break records than tell a compelling story.

The Rock was never the best wrestler, he wasn't a classic in ring mystro, but he's a performer and put on a show. Again Roman can't, and he does really have the in ring work to make up for his lack of character.\\n\\nTake Bret Hart for example, generally Bret was an average mic worker, he wasn't the greatest character worker, but his in ring storytelling and ring craft was on another level and made up for his short comings in other areas. Roman just has none of it, so much so that I really question why WWE invested so much into him for so many years of not being able to do it. Don't get me wrong Roman is fine in the ring and OK on the mic now, but fine and OK aren't worthy of a title let alone the main title, let alone the main title with records left right and centre.
